# Task Scheduling Optimization in Fog-Cloud Environments

This repository contains various scheduling algorithms designed to optimize task allocation in a Fog-Cloud computing environment. The implemented algorithms aim to minimize makespan, energy consumption, and processing costs, providing efficient resource utilization in distributed systems.

## Features

- **Task and Node Initialization:** Random generation of tasks and nodes with diverse characteristics.
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:** 
  - Random Scheduling
  - Power of Two Choices (P2C)
  - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
  - Proposed Hybrid Scheduling

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
